# OSS Stats for <Project>

This repo aims to track stats that affect how <project>'s open source community
interacts with the project and repositories.

It leverages [oss-stats](https://github.com/jaymzh/oss-stats) to track those
stats. It assumes oss-stats and this repo are checked out next to each other
on the filesystem.
