# OSS Stats for YOUR_PROJECT_HERE

This repo aims to track stats that affect how YOUR_PROJECT_HERE's open source
community interacts with the project and repositories.

It leverages [oss-stats](https://github.com/jaymzh/oss-stats) to track those
stats. It assumes oss-stats and this repo are checked out next to each other
on the filesystem.
