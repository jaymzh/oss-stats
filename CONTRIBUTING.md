# Contributing

Contributing to this repo is easy and encouraged! Simply for the repo, make a
branch, push your change and make a Pull Request!

(Shameless plug, [SugarJar](https://github.com/jaymzh/sugarjar) makes that
easier.)

There are a few requirements and things to know.

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

This repo uses [Developer Certificate of
Origin](https://github.com/chef/chef/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#developer-certification-of-origin-dco)
as a way for contributors to attest that they own the changes they are
contributing and are providing them under the license of this repository.

The easiest way to add your DCO is with the `--signoff` flat to `git`, but see
the link above for more details.

*All* commits in your PR must include the DCO.

## Other Requirements

Your PR will go through code review. If changes are requested, simply,
push additional (signed-off) commits, or amend changes and force-push
to your branch.

## Lint

Lint (and eventually unit tests) on the CI pipeline must pass before
your PR will be merged.
