# Repo Stats

[repo_stats](../bin/repo_stats.rb) is a tool designed to give a wide range of
statistics on everything from PRs response time to CI health. It supports both
GitHub and Buildkite and is highly configurable.

It will walk all configured repos in all configured organizations and gather
the desired statistics and print them out in Slack-friendly Markdown.

The tool has 3 modes, and by default runs all 3 (aka `all` mode):

* CI
* PR
* Issue

For each mode, it pulls statistics for the last N days (default: 30).

We'll look at each mode in detail in the sections below.

**NOTE**: These examples specify a single GH Organization and GH Repository on
the command line, but most people will want to use the configuration file to
configure a list of org/repos to walk.

## CI mode

The CI mode walks all CI related to the repositires in question and reports
the number of days they were broken on each branch desired (default: main).

It discovers both GitHub Actions workflows as well as Buildkite Pipelines.  For
Buildkite pipelines, the tool will pull all pipelines in the specified
Buildkite Organization and map them to GitHub repos. In addition, it'll check
the README on every repo it examines and look for any badges that point to a
Buildkite pipeline and attempt to pull status of that (even if it is in a
different Buildkite organization).

For a single repository with both GitHub and Buildkite checks, this is
sample output:

```markdown
*_[chef/chef](https://github.com/chef/chef) Stats (Last 7 days)_*

* CI Stats:
    * Branch: `main` has the following failures:
        * Dependabot Updates / Dependabot: 5 days
        * [BK] chef-oss/chef-chef-main-habitat-test: 3 days
        * [BK] chef-oss/chef-chef-main-verify: 3 days
```

If there is no `--buildkite-org` passed in, no attempt will be made to find
or check any Buildkite pipelines.

## PR and Issues modes

These modes work the same way, but report on PRs or Issues, respectively.
They gather a variety of statistics, and here's some sample output when
both modes are active:

```markdown
*_[chef/chef](https://github.com/chef/chef) Stats (Last 7 days)_*

* PR Stats:
    * Closed PRs: 5
    * Open PRs: 38 (6 opened this period)
    * Oldest Open PR: 2025-03-03 (103 days open, last activity 84 days ago)
    * Stale PR (>30 days without comment): 15
    * Avg Time to Close PRs: 3.02 days

* Issue Stats:
    * Closed Issues: 0
    * Open Issues: 8 (1 opened this period)
    * Oldest Open Issue: 2025-03-06 (100 days open, last activity 72 days ago)
    * Stale Issue (>30 days without comment): 5
    * Avg Time to Close Issues: 0 hours
```

## Configuration File

Unless you only have single repository you're interested in, you'll need to
make a configuration file if you don't want to have to run `repo_stats`
repeatedly. It allows you to specify orgs, repos within those orgs, and
customize branches to check and days to report on by repo.

See [examples/repo_stats_config.rb](../examples/repo_stats_config.rb) for details.

## Threshold Filtering

When working with a large number of repositories, the output of `repo_stats.rb` can become quite verbose. Threshold filtering options allow you to narrow down the report to include only the top N or N% of repositories based on specific criteria. This helps in identifying areas that might need the most attention.

If multiple threshold options are provided, repositories meeting *any* of the specified criteria will be included in the report.

Percentages (`N%`) are calculated based on the total number of repositories being processed in the current run. For example, if 20 repositories are being processed and `--top-n-stale=10%` is used, the top 2 repositories (10% of 20) will be selected for that criterion.

The following threshold filtering options are available:

*   `--top-n-stale=N` or `N%`: Includes the top N or N% of repositories based on the *maximum* stale count of either its Pull Requests or Issues (stale is defined as >30 days without a comment). For example, if a repo has 5 stale PRs and 10 stale Issues, it's ranked by 10.
*   `--top-n-oldest=N` or `N%`: Includes the top N or N% of repositories with the oldest open item (Pull Request or Issue). The age of the single oldest item (be it a PR or an Issue) in a repository is used for comparison.
*   `--top-n-time-to-close=N` or `N%`: Includes the top N or N% of repositories with the highest average time-to-close. The ranking uses the *higher* of the average time-to-close for Pull Requests or the average time-to-close for Issues within a repository.
*   `--top-n-stale-pr=N` or `N%`: Includes the top N or N% of repositories with the most stale Pull Requests.
*   `--top-n-stale-issue=N` or `N%`: Includes the top N or N% of repositories with the most stale Issues.
*   `--top-n-oldest-pr=N` or `N%`: Includes the top N or N% of repositories with the oldest open Pull Requests.
*   `--top-n-oldest-issue=N` or `N%`: Includes the top N or N% of repositories with the oldest open Issues.
*   `--top-n-time-to-close-pr=N` or `N%`: Includes the top N or N% of repositories with the highest average time-to-close for Pull Requests.
*   `--top-n-time-to-close-issue=N` or `N%`: Includes the top N or N% of repositories with the highest average time-to-close for Issues.
*   `--top-n-most-broken-ci-days=N` or `N%`: Includes the top N or N% of repositories with the highest total number of days CI jobs were reported as broken across all checked branches.
*   `--top-n-most-broken-ci-jobs=N` or `N%`: Includes the top N or N% of repositories with the highest number of distinct CI jobs that were reported as broken across all checked branches.

### Examples

Here are a few examples of how to use the threshold filtering options:

*   To see the top 5 repositories with the most stale items (based on max of PRs or Issues) in the "myorg" GitHub organization:
    ```bash
    bin/repo_stats.rb --github-org myorg --top-n-stale=5
    ```

*   To see the top 10% of repositories with the oldest open items, combined with the top 3 repositories that had CI jobs broken for the most number of days, using a configuration file:
    ```bash
    bin/repo_stats.rb --config /path/to/your/repo_stats_config.rb --top-n-oldest=10% --top-n-most-broken-ci-days=3
    ```

*   To see the top 2 repositories with the highest number of distinct broken CI jobs:
    ```bash
    bin/repo_stats.rb --github-org myorg --mode ci --top-n-most-broken-ci-jobs=2
    ```

*   To see the top 3 repositories with the most stale Pull Requests in "myorg":
    ```bash
    bin/repo_stats.rb --github-org myorg --top-n-stale-pr=3
    ```

*   To see the top 5% of repositories with the oldest open Issues, using a configuration file:
    ```bash
    bin/repo_stats.rb --config /path/to/your/repo_stats_config.rb --top-n-oldest-issue=5%
    ```

*   To see repositories that are in the top 2 by max stale items (PR or Issue) OR in the top 4 by stale PRs specifically:
    ```bash
    bin/repo_stats.rb --github-org myorg --top-n-stale=2 --top-n-stale-pr=4
    ```
